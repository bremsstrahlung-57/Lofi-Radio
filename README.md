# Lo-fi Radio 
A simple Lo-fi music player built with vanilla JavaScript. The app uses the [Lo-fi Radio API](https://lofi-radio-man.vercel.app/) to stream relaxing beats while you work, study, or unwind.

I used youtube iframe api and made it's display none ^_^


# Vanilla JavaScript project

With this template project you can quickly start using Vanilla JS!

## Setup
```
npm i
```

In order to download the development dependencies.

You may use other package managers with its respective commands, if you wish so.

## Run
You may simply insert the `index.html` file path into your browser to see your app.

But if there are problems with [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), JavaScript modules, or with your workflow in general, you might prefer to use a live local server to host your app as well as reloading it on every file change.

To start the live server, use

```
npm run dev
```

and it will be served at `http://localhost:8080`.
